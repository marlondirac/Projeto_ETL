# Projeto_ETL

This project was made in Python using these libs: Pandas and Pyspark!

I received a dataset and i made it in four parts:
+ Infrastructure using the Google Cloud Plataform for create a link from Cloud Storage. Although i sent the Local version here with the brute Dataset.csv. To execute the code, please download the archive 'marketing.csv';
+ I pushed the dataset previously the modifications in Atlas MongoDB and next his modifications on two collections respectively;
+ Firstly, the clean process, i made it with Pandas, because is easiest to use in this context;
+ Then, next the all clean process, i used the Pyspark lib to create columns and his Queries with Spark.SQL to show my insides from the Table.
